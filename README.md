Through this project, I learned the basics of Node.js, including setting up a server, handling requests and responses, and working with middleware using Express.js.

I explored asynchronous programming, error handling, and database integration with Sequelize.

This hands-on experience helped me understand how to build and deploy scalable APIs.
